Question 1: 

int a = 10;
int* p = &a;
*p = 20;
std::cout << a;

Output: 20
Will it compile: Yes
Memory Leak/Dangling Pointer: No

Question 2: 
int* p = nullptr;
*p = 5;

Output: (nothing)
Will it compile: Yes
Memory Leak/Dangling Pointer: No

Question 2.1
int a = 5;
int* p = &a;
int b = *p;
*p = 10;
std::cout << a << " " << b;

Output: 10 5
Will it compile: Yes
Memory Leak/Dangling Pointer: No


Question 3
int* p = new int(5);
delete p;
*p = 10;

Output: (nothing)
Will it compile: Yes
Memory Leak/Dangling Pointer: Dangling Pointer *p is trying to manipulate something that is not defined.

Question 4
int a = 10;
float* p = (float*)&a;
std::cout << *p;

Output: 4013e-44
Will it compile: Yes
Memory Leak/Dangling Pointer: No

Question 5
int a = 5;
int* p = &a;
p = nullptr;
*p = 10;

Output:
Will it compile:
